It will look inside the current directory, and recurse through every folder.

It will then add all the git repos it finds to a JSON file

The JSON file will respect the file hierarchy in which it found the git repos 

## TS, ESM, Stuff

```bash
node --experimental-specifier-resolution=node # lets you leave off the file extensions
```
